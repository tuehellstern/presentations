### or why this archaeologist-cum-historian is speaking to you today.


### Big Data Has Ever Been With Us

<small> Monte Testaccio, 19th C, Rome: one giant repository of archaeological data. 

20 000 m2, 35 m high, 580 000 m3.</small>


### Think how much data Carp Landfill contains!

## 'Data Speak for Themselves'

Nope. 

Sorry.


+ folks who talk about 'the end of theory' are making a profound mistake.
+ wouldn't you like to know what the correlations you find might _mean_?

## Hire my history students.


It's easier than ever before to measure. To measure implies control.
> it's a kind of digital enclosure act.

> once enclosed, somebody can own it.

> who owns you?


### Data are Capta
datum - is something given, out there, objective

capta - is something taken, brought in, subjective.


### What we're really talking about is
## Big Capta


### for example: n-grams
> 'Pursuit of Happiness'

+ You can plot the occurrence of the phrase over time, from scanned books.


+ But which books?
+ How good is your scan?
+ What is the actual _context_ of the phrase?


> 'happiness' means different things at different times.


+ up until 1770s, 'happiness' almost always in a religious context:
+ "eternal happiness".
+ therefore its use in secular context signals something new


The ngram doesn't give you this. But the historian Tim Hitchcock does.

[Hitchcock, 'Big data, small meanings'](http://historyonics.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/big-data-small-data-and-meaning_9.html)


Every choice you make - about what to collect, how to collect it, how you munge it, how you clean it, how you represent it - depends on your worldview. 

That is to say, theory helps us unpack worldviews and their artefacts.


### Big data needs the humanities

+ [Dalton and Thatcher - 'What does a critical data studies look like, and why do we care? Seven points for a critical approach to big data'](http://societyandspace.com/material/commentaries/craig-dalton-and-jim-thatcher-what-does-a-critical-data-studies-look-like-and-why-do-we-care-seven-points-for-a-critical-approach-to-big-data/)
+ Remember, data are always cooked. Think of us as food critics.
 


### Nah. Not critics. 

## Actually, we're storytellers

That's why Humanities & Big Data are not in competition.


>They are complementary. Together, they tell a better story.


+ the tools of big data allow me a macroscopic view on my materials
+ they help me figure out where to focus my microscope


+ and the microscope tells me where the macroscope needs adjusting.


### (And help us avoid just-so stories)

Much much data! Drawn from climatological records

+ machine learning allows Schmidt to pull out patterns within the entire corpus
+ implications for understanding America's power & history of capitalism

> Digitization makes the most traditional forms of humanistic scholarship more necessary, not less. But the differences mean that we need to reinvent, not reaffirm, the way that historians do history.

## My research
![minion](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/411694091538165760/WO9XkQZa.jpeg)

+ I explore the tools themselves, & help others to use them wisely


+ I map historical consciousness online
+ I simulate social processes of the past, grounded in archaeological data
+ I do computational historiography (aka topic modeling archaeological archives)
